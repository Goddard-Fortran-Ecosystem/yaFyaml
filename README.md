Yet Another Fortran YAML

There is at least one other open source Fortran-based YAML parser.  

The rationale for this one is simply to be compatible with the containers in gFTL.   It is not intended to be a complete YAML parser, just the subset needed by my own projects.    (Happy to accept additional contributed YAML capabilities, of course!)
